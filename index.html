          description: 'Classic voice training text',
          content: `When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a person looks for something beyond their reach, their friends say they are looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.

Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of superimposition of a number of bows. If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.`

away we went down the shore of the lake, up the valley of rolling stones; he
doubled into Brawling River and took to the water, but I swam after him; the
river is only half a mile broad there, but it runs strong. He went spinning down
the rapids, down I went in pursuit; he clambered ashore, I clambered ashore;
away we tore helter-skelter up the hill and down again. I lost him in the
marshes, got on his track again near Bread Fruit Wood, and brought him down

guaranteed to be glorious and memorable and sparkling with gowns and
cumberbunds. Prom is the quintessential teenage experience. Think of the
unlucky grown-ups and the elderly who lament the day they decided not to go to
the Prom. It is a key ingredient to a happy and meaningful life. Prom is short for
Promenade, a slow, gentle walk through a shady glen, and this beloved
ceremony symbolizes our journey from the shadows of adolescence to the bright
sunshine of the adult world with all its freedoms. And it may be the only chance
I'll ever have to dance with someone. Maybe I'll never have someone get down
on a knee and offer me a diamond ring. Maybe I'll never walk down the aisle with
a smug look of bridal triumph. But it is my right, and the right of every
book-wormy, soon-to-be librarian to have one night of Cinderella magic. Even if
we have to go with our cousin, or our gay best friend from tap class, we will have
a Prom. And you will help me.`

no more fun. No more drinking, no more getting worked up, no more smoking,
apparently – I'm ignoring that, obviously but. I'm getting pills, blood-thinners.
They've showered me with leaflets. The consultant basically said I could pop my
clogs at any moment. Added to which: he was a very pale man, heavy-breather –
I did wonder briefly if he might actually be Death, come to get me. But then one
of the other doctors popped in, called him Nigel, mentioned something about
badminton so I thought: probably not. It's hard to imagine the Grim Reaper with a
shuttlecock. But that's not the worst bit, Stephen. Picture this: I've been through
all the sitting, the waiting, been wired up to a monitor, jogged, et cetera, I've been
jiggled about, prodded, pressed with some very chilly instruments, got released,
finally, back into the world, with my clogged-up arteries and uncertain future, I'm
in the lift going down, who should get into the lift with me on floor number seven?
I'll give you a clue: he's got a fucking hernia. And did he ask how I was? No. He
spotted me, took a deep breath, launched into another two-hour rant about what
a rough deal it is – complaining, whining. I mean, I know it's not nice to have a bit
