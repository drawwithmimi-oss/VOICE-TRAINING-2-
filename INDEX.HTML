away we went down the shore of the lake, up the valley of rolling stones; he
doubled into Brawling River and took to the water, but I swam after him; the
river is only half a mile broad there, but it runs strong. He went spinning down
the rapids, down I went in pursuit; he clambered ashore, I clambered ashore;
away we tore helter-skelter up the hill and down again. I lost him in the
marshes, got on his track again near Bread Fruit Wood, and brought him down

cumberbunds. Prom is the quintessential teenage experience. Think of the
unlucky grown-ups and the elderly who lament the day they decided not to go to
the Prom. It is a key ingredient to a happy and meaningful life. Prom is short for
Promenade, a slow, gentle walk through a shady glen, and this beloved
ceremony symbolizes our journey from the shadows of adolescence to the bright
sunshine of the adult world with all its freedoms. And it may be the only chance
I'll ever have to dance with someone. Maybe I'll never have someone get down
on a knee and offer me a diamond ring. Maybe I'll never walk down the aisle with
a smug look of bridal triumph. But it is my right, and the right of every
book-wormy, soon-to-be librarian to have one night of Cinderella magic. Even if
we have to go with our cousin, or our gay best friend from tap class, we will have
a Prom. And you will help me.`

no more fun. No more drinking, no more getting worked up, no more smoking,

They've showered me with leaflets. The consultant basically said I could pop my
clogs at any moment. Added to which: he was a very pale man, heavy-breather –
I did wonder briefly if he might actually be Death, come to get me. But then one
of the other doctors popped in, called him Nigel, mentioned something about
badminton so I thought: probably not. It's hard to imagine the Grim Reaper with a

jiggled about, prodded, pressed with some very chilly instruments, got released,
